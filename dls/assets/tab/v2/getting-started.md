#Getting Started
<br>
Before we can start building complex systems and computers, we have to install the software.<br>
If you want to do this step by yourself of already have the program installed, you can skip this step.
<br><br><br>
First things first, we will have to go to the [itch.io page](https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim) of the project.<br>
You can find the site by clicking [Here](https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim) or [There](https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim).

After that, you need to scroll down and click the `download` button.

<br><br>
`Digital Logic Sim` is free but you should really consider donating at least a Dollar.<br>
You can enter the ammount you want to donate in the box and pay with either card or PayPal.<br>
If you've decided not to donate, you can just click the underscored text above the text box,<br>
and it will take you to the download page.
<br><br>

<br><br>
On the download page, you will find three files and you just have to click the `download` button for the correct file (e.g. Mac if you're on a mac) and the download should begin shortly.

<br><br>
You're almost there!<br>
The only thing left to do now is to extract everything from the `.zip` archive, go inside the `Digital-Logic-Sim` folder and run `Digital-Logic-Sim.exe`.<br>
And there you go! You can now simulate digital logic as much as you want!

But- what's that?! there is only a `NAND` gate! what am I supposed to do with that?! Where did the `AND` and `NOT` gates go?!
<br><br>
All of that and more will be discussed on the next page: [NAND what now?](?post=v2_what-now)
