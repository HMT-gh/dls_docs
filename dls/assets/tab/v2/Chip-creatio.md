#Chip Creation
<br>
Creating a chip is very straight forward.
<br><br>
In V2 of  `Digital Logic Sim`, the process for saving a chip is a little bit different than in V1 but it's very easy still.
<br><br>
To save a chip, you just have to either press [`Ctrl + S`](?post=v2_shortcuts) or click the `MENU` button in the bottom left corner and select `SAVE CHIP`.
<br><br>

<br><br>
You'll now see a box where you can enter the name of your chip.<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
After you've entered the name, you should be able to click `SAVE`.
<br><br>
But before that, let's click on `CUSTOMIZE`, shall we?
<br><br>
A customization menu will then open, where you can edit the size, color, text position and (if you have any) the position of any displays, you might have added, and whether or not to show them on the chip.

#Chip Size
<br>
To adjust the chip size, you need to pull on an arrow to change the size in that side. The oposite side will mirrir the adjustment.<br>
(Tipp: Use [`Ctrl`](?post=v2_shortcuts) to snap to grid)

#Name Display
<br>
Let's now look at displaying the Chip's name.
<br><br>
There are three ways of displaying the name that you can switch between, using the arrows above the color selector:
<br><br>

<br>
Hidden
<br><br>
#Color
<br>
You just need to adjust the slider to change the hue and move the circle in the color box to change Saturation and Brightness.
<br><br>

<br><br>
#Displays
<br>
You can add displays to your chips by selecting the desired display in the menu below the color picker.
<br><br>
![Display Menu](/assets/img/v2/getting-started/custom-display-menu.webp)
<br><br>
After adding the display to the scene, you need to drag it into the bounds of the chip, unless you want a cut-off display.<br>
You can use the white corner that apear when hovering over the display to resize it. ([`Ctrl`](?post=v2_shortcuts) Grid Snap works for this too!)

Currently, there are three kinds of displays:
