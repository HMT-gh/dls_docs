#NAND what now?
<br>
So, you've installed the program and have everything set up but- wait... why is there only a `NAND` gate?
<br><br>
Don't worry! In this segment, I'll show you step-by-step how you can build your very own logic gates using nothing but the `NAND` gate!
<br><br>
But before you start making logic gates, you should take a look at the [`Chip Creation` page](?post=v2_chip-creatio).
<br><br>
# 
##NAND functionality
<br>
Let's first look at how `NAND` gates work.<br>
A `NAND` gate is essentially a reversed `AND` gate:
| IN A | IN B | AND | NAND |
| ---- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| <p style="color: #bf1029;">false 0</p> | <p style="color: #bf1029;">false 0</p> | <p style="color: #bf1029;">false 0</p> | <p style="color: #056517;">true 1</p> |
| <p style="color: #056517;">true 1</p> | <p style="color: #bf1029;">false 0</p> | <p style="color: #bf1029;">false 0</p> | <p style="color: #056517;">true 1</p> |
| <p style="color: #bf1029;">false 0</p> | <p style="color: #056517;">true 1</p> | <p style="color: #bf1029;">false 0</p> | <p style="color: #056517;">true 1</p> |
| <p style="color: #056517;">true 1</p> | <p style="color: #056517;">true 1</p> | <p style="color: #056517;">true 1</p> | <p style="color: #bf1029;">false 0</p> |

<br>
So you can just create one using the other by running the `OUT` pin through a `NOT` gate.
<br><br>
But- wait.. how do we do that? We don't have a `NOT` gate. We only have a `NAND` gate.<br>
Well, let's see what happens if we connect both of the `NAND`'s `IN` pins to the same source (if `IN A` is 1, `IN B` will be too):
| IN | OUT |
| ---- | ---- |
| <p style="color: #bf1029;">false 0</p> | <p style="color: #056517;">true 1</p> |
| <p style="color: #056517;">true 1</p> | <p style="color: #bf1029;">false 0</p> |

<br>
Now, that looks awfully simmilar to the truth table of a `NOT` gate!
<br><br>

<br>
Knowing how a `NAND` gate works, let's take a stab at creating our first two logic gates.
<br><br>

##AND
<br>
The `AND` gate is pretty straight forward, given what we discussed in the `NAND functionality` section.<br><br>
We just have to chain two NAND gates together like this:
<br><br>

<br>
After connecting the `NAND` gates and `I/O` pins, we can move on to saving the chip.<br>
In V2 of  `Digital Logic Sim`, the process for saving a chip is a little bit different than in V1.<br>
You can find an in-depth explanation on the [`Chip Creation` page](?post=v2_chip-creatio).<br>
On this page, however, I will only show you a simple way to save chips without any customization.
<br><br>
# 
##Saving Chips
<br>
To save a chip, you just have to either press [`Ctrl + S`](?post=v2_shortcuts) or click the `MENU` button in the bottom left corner and select `SAVE CHIP`.
<br><br>
![Save Chip Selected in Menu](/assets/img/v2/getting-started/menu-save-chip-selected.webp)
<br><br>
You'll now see a box where you can enter the name of your chip (in this case `AND`).<br>
We'll ignere the `CUSTOMIZE` button for now.
<br><br>
![Save Chip Menu](/assets/img/v2/getting-started/save-chip-menu.webp)
<br><br>
After you've entered the name, you should be able to click `SAVE`.<br><br>
And there you go! You just created your first chip! Way to go!
<br><br>
# 
##NOT
<br>
Making a `NOT` gate is actually even easier than making an `AND` gate, since you only need a single `NAND` gate.<br><br>
As we've discussed previously, to make a not gate, we just have to connect both `IN` pins of the `NAND` gate to the same source pin:
<br><br>
![AND gate from NANDs](/assets/img/v2/getting-started/nand-to-NOT.webp)
<br><br>
# 
<br><br>
Great! We should be able to make a lot more, now that we have the `AND` gate and the `NOT`gate!<br>
But before we get to complex chips like `SR-Latches` or `ALU`s, why don't we make a few more logic gates.
<br><br>
##OR
<br>
Given what we've learned today, making an `OR` gate will be really easy.<br><br>
In this example, I'll be using three `NAND` gates, but you can replace the first two `NAND` gates with a `NOT` gate each.<br><br>
If we negate the output of a `NAND` gate, we get an `AND` gate. But if we negate the input, we get an `OR` gate:
