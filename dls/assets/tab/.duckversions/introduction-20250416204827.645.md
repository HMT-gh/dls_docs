# Introduction

> This is an unofficial Documentation for <a href="https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim" target="_blank">`Digital logic Sim`</a>, a program created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ" target="_blank">Sebastian Lague</a>. I am in no way affiliated with him, apart from, that I'm a big fan of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a> and the projects he has made.<br><br>
This site is still under construction.
